<h3>Week 1: Final Project Proposal</h3>

<p class = "margin"></p>
<p class = "margin"></p>
Here are 2 potential (and in the works) ideas for my final project
<p class = "margin"></p>

<h4>Idea 1: Automatic card game helper</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>
<h5><b>This invention can help with people trying to play games in big groups but are tired of dealing/shuffling.</b></h5>
<p class = "margin"></p>

<h6> This project would utilize a motor to rotate around a table and pass out cards. I also wanted to potentitally include different game modes -- games like spoons or poker could also work. I want to give it the ability to shuffle cards on its own as well, and while challenging, I want to try. I believe something similar already exists but I want to customie my own for games I play.

<h4>Idea 2: Anti-procrasination chair device</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>
<p class = "margin"></p>



<h5><b>This invention can allow someone to effectively get through their work by sensing if they are focused or not. </b></h5>
<p class = "margin"></p>
<p class = "margin"></p>

<h6> It will be a pad that you place on your desk. When you sit down on the chair, a sensor detects it and starts a customizable pomodoro timer. If you stand up and walk away or use your device, the timer resets. Also, I want to use LED lights on the device that represent different states: green = focused, blue = break, and red = session interrupted. The lights will slowly progress along the pad as you focus. If you break your streak, there will be some sort of consequence like a water squirt or a loud alarm. I also want to implement a point system - 25 points for example grants 10 min of screentime.</h6>

<h4>Idea 3: Automatic laundry sorter</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>
     <h5><b>As someone who hates to do laundry and seperate my clothing, this invention can ease the task. It skips the steps of checking all your clothes and forgetting things. </b></h5>
<p class = "margin"></p>

<h6> The machine would use color sensors to seperate the clothing into different compartments. It could use an RGB color sensor. Users would throw clothing into the funnel and a small conveyor belt/platform will lead the clothes to the different compartments. Also, maybe the machine could detect the wetness of clothing items to seperate sweaty/dirtier clothes. Finally, when the baskets are full, the machine can detect and alert the user. When detecting items like pennies or credit cards as well, the machine can alert the user. </h6>
