<h3>Week 5: 3D Design & Printing</h3>
  <p class="margin">   </p>

<h2><b><u><i>Card Shuffler:</h2></u></b></i>
   <p class="margin">   </p>
<h4> For my 3d printing project, I decided to make a component/function of my final project. I thought it would be really cool to make an automatic card shuffler as a feature of my game machine at the end. The cards would first shuffle in the machine, then pass out to each player in the room. I found a function on youtube and used it as a blueprint, and continued to model my own machine. I 3d printed some of the components (not all because I wanted to test it and save time on the 3d printer) and plan to 3d print the entire machine at the end.

<h4> I attached a DC motor onto the back of the machine and 3d printed the wheels/ walls. I attached rubber bands onto the wheels to create enough fiction for the cards to go through. After a few tests, the machine finally worked and was able to push out cards into a middle pile:

<h6><b> In my final project, I'll have two machines launching cards in the middle, therefore shuffling cards evenly. I just wanted to test out the functionality of one of them.
<p class="margin">   </p>
<h4> For my 3d modeling, I used parameters to measure out the card dimensions. Next time im going to measure out drill holes to make a stable build. This prototype helped me visualize the function of my final design.

<h2><b><u><i>3D Scan:</h2></u></b></i>

<h4> Due to a big line at the revoscanner, I decided to try out an application on my phone for scanning. I tried scanning my headphones, and they turned out decently well. At first, the scan caught lots of the table but I was able to trim it down. It's not perfect, but the app still did a good job. I used an app called "Polycam," which would allow you to take multiple photos from different angles and generate your scan.

<h2><b><u><i>Final Project Updates:</h2></u></b></i>

<h3><b> Project goals: <h3> </b>
<h4> Rather than simply an uno machine, I want to make a general purpose type game machine that I can use to play with my friends. For functionalities, I want it to be able to shuffle cards and distribute cards based on the amount of players.

    <td><h5><b>Wood</td>
    <td><h5>Laser cutter: I need wood for the base and some components of the box holding the cards.</td>

   <tr>
    <td><h5><b>3D printing</td>
    <td><h5>Majority of the machine will be 3D printed. I want to 3d printer gears and control them with a microcontroller at specific angles. </td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td><h5><b>Servo motor (?)</td>
    <td><h5>Not too sure about this one yet: I want to somehow turn the entire mechanism to face each player, and a servo motor seems ideal but only turns 180.</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td><h5><b>Motion sensor [TBD]</td>
    <td><h5>Potentially, I want to try coidng the machine to turn/distribute cards to whoever is pressing/apply pressure on the table.</td>
  </tr>
 
</table>
<h3><b> Timeline: <h3> </b>
  <h4>This week, I want to figure out the motorization for spinning the mechanism. I also want to print out a cardboard prototype of my updated card shuffler function. 
  Next week, I want to test if the sensors work or not -- and possibly look into a LED screen.
  TBD.
