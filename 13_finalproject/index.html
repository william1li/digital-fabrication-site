<h3>Week 10</h3>
<h1><b><i><u>FINAL PROJECT: ShuffleBot </u></i></b></h1>
<p class="margin">   </p>
<h4> For my final project, I combined all the functionalities that I've been working on the past weeks. Therefore, I'm excited to introduce the <b>ShuffleBot</b> -- a machine that simplifies the card playing process and works for all card game lovers! </h4>

<h4> As someone who loves playing card games with friends, I always struggled with one thing -- shuffling. I was awful at it and at the beginning of the program, nobody in my group knew how to shuffle cards. Every game we played was a struggle and took extremely long to begin due to shuffling. Therefore, I wanted to take the situation in my own hands and create an automatic shuffler. I've seen inspiration online, but most machines cost a decent amount so why not make it myself? </h4>

  <h3><b>Function 1: Shuffling</b></h3>
  <h4>
    I've been working on the shuffling function for a few weeks now, as seen in 
    <a href="https://william1li.github.io/Digital-fabrication/05_3Ddesign/index.html">week 5</a> and 
    <a href="https://william1li.github.io/Digital-fabrication/07_outputs/index.html">week 7</a>. I've been working on my final project idea since the beginning, so now all I had to do was perfect it. In week 7, I struggled with the issue of the cards coming out correctly, so this time I cut out the pieces in wood. In fusion, I also modeled all the pieces perfectly to fit with eachother.

    <h6 style="margin-top: 5px; font-style: italic;">
      Unfortunately, in the first iteration, I realized that the pieces I cut to hold the cards were too small, so I had to reprint two pieces.

      I then assembled everything with M2 wood screws and tested out the functionality for the first time. It worked, so now it was time for testing.

<h3><b><u> Testing </u></b></h3>
<h4>
After assembling the base shuffler build, I had to debug some of the issues that came with it. Throughout my testing, I simply connected the red and black wires of the dc motors to GND and 5V of my breadboard. After hours of testing, I was stuck on why the shuffling kept getting stuck. Eventually, I found out that the cards needed some sort of pressure at the front -- otherwise there wasnt enough weight to launch them through the small hole. Combined with increasing the voltage at a voltmeter, I placed erasers on the front of the decks and it worked perfectly. </h4>

    <h6 style="margin-top: 5px; font-style: italic;">
      This was the first video I have of the cards fully shuffling -- before they would continously get stuck. Now, it was time to figure out how to design a weight that wasn't erasers...
    </h6>
</div>

<p class="margin"></p>

<h4>
  I was able to figure this function out due to some research on YouTube, especially this 
  <b><a href="https://youtu.be/9TeUHlfm-Wo?si=lZoJ52mnQFu9CAkf" target="_blank">video</a></b>. 
  I studied specifically how they managed to get the cards to move smoothly. This is where I learned I needed more voltage.

  <h3><b>Function 2: Distribution</b></h3>
  <h4>Distribution was the hardest aspect of my project. I had multiple ideas, watching multiple youtube videos on how others distributed:</h4>

  <!-- Option 1 -->

    <h6 style="margin-top: 5px; font-style: italic;">
      <span style="font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: bold;">Option 1:</span> 
      I wanted to use this mechanism but realized there would be no way for all the cards to fall because of the extruding part.

    <h6 style="margin-top: 5px; font-style: italic;">
      <span style="font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: bold;">Option 2:</span> 
      There was simply not enough space in the center area for all the cards to land perfectly while having this mechanism at the same time.

      <span style="font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: bold;">Option 3:</span> 
      This had the same problem as the first one: how would the shuffled cards land with the extruding part?

<h4> After lots of consideration and blueprinting, I decided to combine these options into one that would fit my design. First, I realized the 3d printed card holder box I originally prototyped wasn't tall enough to hold all the cards, so I laser cutted a new box (simply 6 sides): </h4>
<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; align-items: flex-start; gap: 20px; margin-top: 15px;">
  <!-- Wheel image -->

    <img src="wheel+box.jpg" alt="Wheel Assembly" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
    <h6 style="margin-top: 5px; font-style: italic;">
      I 3d printed a gear box and attatched wheels to the dc motor. I then glued the gearbox onto the bottom of the card holder box. The wheels go through the bottom of the box because of two cut out holes, just enough to touch the cards and propel them outwards.
    </h6>
  </div>

<h4> Now, it was time for testing. I first wanted to determine the pressure needed for the cards to go through. I added a piece in the front of the box that allowed just enough space for two cards to go through. The main goal was also to make contact with the rubber bands on the wheel to launch the cards out.

    <h6 style="margin-top: 5px; font-style: italic;">
      I grabbed some pieces of dense metal to test the pressure required for the cards to propel through.

    <h6 style="color: white; font-style: italic; text-align: center; margin: 0;">This is when I came up with the idea of using magnets: I thought if I put one magnet on the cards and one below, it would provide the perfect amount of pressure. Unfortunately, this idea failed because at the end of the deck, the magnetic force would become too strong and trap the cards.</h6>

    <h6 style="color: white; font-style: italic; text-align: center; margin: 0;">I decided to cut out a small piece of wood and recut the backing of my machine. Therefore, I created a lever-type (attatched by masking tape for flexibility) of function that would only drop down when the cards finished shuffling, eliminating the issue of space. Unfortunately, it didn't work too well the first time and I needed some adjustments. </h6>

<!-- END: 6-Box Video Grid Section -->
<h4> Overall, while I originally wanted the cards to launch out fully, having a dispenser-type function worked just as well. Also, i was happy with the 2 card limit that I implemented and measured. Card distribution took a long time and in the future, I can see myself attempting a different design.</h4>

      Unfortunately, after hours of testing and wiring, the stepper would not work. In this picture, you can see I connected the part to the stepper, but there was an extreme amount of interference. Everytime I even hovered my finger over the microcontroller, the stepper would begin moving on its own. Overall, it was impossible to code the stepper due to the massive interference, so I decided to focus on the other functions instead.

<h4>After I got each individual part working, I began wiring everything together. Assembling was easy because I designed each part to fit together perfectly in fusion. I ran into multiple issues in wiring, however.</h4>

<h4> For future improvements, I definitley want to use a stepper to get the project to spin. I will continue making iterations of the project, including making packaging for the wiring! I have many ideas to come, and since I brought my project home, i will continue working on it until I perfect it and create the features I want. Some other features include a oled screen that displays players, a method to shoot out the cards fully, and entirely making structure smaller. <b> If I were to do this project differently, </b>I would definitley distribute my timing better. Unfortunately, during most of the process, I was extremely sick so I was unable to work on it to the best of my ability. Therefore, next time I hope to manage my time better, but overall I am happy with the final product. </h4>
